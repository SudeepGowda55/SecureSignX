ðŸ§ª Secure SignX is a decentralized compliance and audit trail system for managing document Attestations via Sign Protocol, with Secure communication through XMTP and streamlined interactions using a MessageKit Bot

Secure SignX involves two major components

**Sign Protocol**

Currently, the Secure SignX Attestation Schema is deployed on **Base Sepolia Testnet**

[SecureSignx Sign Protocol Schema](https://testnet-scan.sign.global/schema/onchain_evm_84532_0x22c)

Workflow:

1. The employee should connect his wallet and then needs to upload the legal Document.
   
2. Then the attestation to any legal document can be created only by the Compliance Officer/Auditor.

3. Then the manager can review the attested documents.


You can view the **Attestations created on Sign Protocol** from here (https://testnet-scan.sign.global/schema/onchain_evm_84532_0x22c)

<br />

The second major component here is **XMTP Protocol**

A **Compliance Bot** built using **MessageKit** assists users based on their roles: **Manager**, **Compliance Officer**, and **User**. 

The bot is deployed and can be interacted with at the address: *0x9223a195cbaC6D5411367e7f316F900670a11d77*.

To see available commands and functionality, simply type **"help"** in the conversation with the bot through **XMTP**.
